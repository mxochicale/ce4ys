# Code of Ethics for Young Researchers

## Engage with the public
Engaging with the public means having an open two-way 
communication about science and the implications of research, 
as well as its need for society. Such communication involves active, 
objective and unbiased listening, discussing and questioning by 
both parties to enable the transfer of scientific knowledge 
into public wisdom. 
Indeed, researchers have a responsibility to engage in public 
discourse with all members of society and to make science 
more accessible. In return, the public will be more inclined 
to listen to, question and trust scientists.

## Pursue the truth
Pursuing the truth means following the research where it leads, 
rather than confirming an already formed opinion. 
This is particularly challenging but necessary when questioning 
current beliefs. The discovered truth must be confirmed and 
verified by peers, which requires transparency and 
reproducibility in all steps of the research and publication, 
in the methods used and by providing access to raw data. 
Results must be represented accurately without over- or understatement, 
hiding facts and/or drawbacks, or misleading the reader in any way. 
They must be based on evidence and observations, 
rather than on preconceived truths or biases.


## Minimize harm
Minimizing harm means that research inevitably carries some risk and, 
while it may be impossible to eliminate it, researchers can minimize 
harm to science, to others, to the environment, 
to society and to themselves. 
Despite the risk, society accords scientists extraordinary 
privileges to pursue research, and thus they have a duty to 
safeguard society against excess risk by taking steps to foresee, 
acknowledge and prevent harmful investigation. 
Every researcher must consider each experiment’s potential to cause 
harm and evaluate whether the generated knowledge can be detrimental 
to society.

## Engage with decision-makers
Engaging with decision-makers means going beyond developing solutions, 
conducting experiments and publishing data. 
Situations arise in which there is an ethical responsibility 
to engage with decision-makers, for instance to understand 
the impact of climate change on populations. 
Other situations exist in which research is only possible 
by engaging with decision-makers, for example to access 
government or corporate data sets, facilities or resources. 
This engagement may be at any or all stages of the research 
process as needed.

## Support diversity
Supporting diversity means providing an environment in which 
the ideas of all are evaluated equally, regardless of individual 
characteristics, on the basis of evidence. 
Diversity is not simply the representation of individuals and ideas 
but is actual inclusion, which can only be achieved by creating a 
culture of openness and recognizing and addressing unconscious bias. 
Achieving this representation may require seeking out participation 
from under-represented groups, while ensuring that the 
research process and its outcomes do not negatively affect 
particular groups.


## Be a mentor
Being a mentor means trusting and empowering less experienced 
researchers, especially during the early stages of their careers, 
to help them reach their professional goals and realize their 
full potential. It means creating an environment of trust and 
respect for all individuals in the scientific workplace, 
being available when needed and devoting time to listen to 
and address the concerns of mentees. 
Mentoring aims to communicate experience and values in a 
trusted and confidential environment.

## Be accountable
Being accountable means taking responsibility for one’s actions 
when carrying out research and raising a red flag if one’s 
commitments are at risk, taking corrective steps when necessary. 
Scientists have a moral but also financial responsibility to answer 
questions raised by society, a core funder of research. 
They must use resources efficiently, not being wasteful and 
focusing on overall social welfare in all actions. 
Trusted to guide and educate individuals, researchers must serve 
as examples of ethical behaviour for their students and society. 
They also have a duty to secure this trust and hold each other 
accountable for research results.
